# AI Image Analyzer

A mobile-friendly web app that analyzes images via URL using OpenAI's GPT Vision API. This tool helps determine if an image is AI-generated by providing a description, likelihood score, and specific visual features supporting the analysis.

## Features

- **URL-based Image Analysis**: Analyze any publicly accessible image by URL
- **AI-generated Detection**: Get an assessment of whether an image is likely AI-generated
- **Detailed Analysis**: Receive a description and specific visual features supporting the assessment
- **Mobile Responsive**: Fully responsive design using Fluent UI
- **Shareable Results**: Generate shareable links to analysis results
- **Caching**: Recent analyses are cached for faster repeat access

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React + Vite + TypeScript + Fluent UI React components
- Backend: Node.js (Vercel serverless function)
- API: OpenAI SDK with GPT-4o Vision capabilities

## Setup & Development

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-image-analyzer.git
cd ai-image-analyzer
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your OpenAI API key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

4. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Deployment to Vercel

1. Install Vercel CLI (if not already installed)

```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

2. Login to Vercel

```bash
vercel login
```

3. Deploy to Vercel

```bash
vercel
```

4. Add your OpenAI API Key to Vercel Environment Variables

   - Go to your project on the Vercel dashboard
   - Navigate to Settings > Environment Variables
   - Add a new variable with key `OPENAI_API_KEY` and your API key as the value
   - Redeploy your application to apply the changes

5. (Optional) Configure custom domain

   - In the Vercel dashboard, go to your project
   - Navigate to Settings > Domains
   - Add your custom domain and follow the instructions

## Usage

1. Enter a valid image URL in the input field
2. Click "Analyze Image"
3. View the results, including:
   - Image preview
   - Description of the image
   - AI likelihood score and label
   - Specific reasons for the assessment
4. Share the analysis using the "Share Result" or "Copy Link" buttons

## Notes

- The app only works with publicly accessible image URLs
- The analysis is performed using OpenAI's GPT-4o model which has vision capabilities
- The app caches the last 5 analyzed URLs to improve performance
